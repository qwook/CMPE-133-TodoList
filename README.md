# Model-View-Controller in a Web Application

In this project, I created a todo-list application using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

To make this project possible, I used the framework [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) which combines the controller and the view together into one neat class.

The language used is JSX, which is built on Javascript. It allows for creation of views using HTML-like syntax.
